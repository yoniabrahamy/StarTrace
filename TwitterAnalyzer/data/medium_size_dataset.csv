"negative","a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan ."
"negative","samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal"
"negative",". . . routine , harmless diversion and little else ."
"negative","late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet ."
"negative","this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again ."
"negative","while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer"
"negative","it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth ."
"negative","let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly "" inspired "" was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen ."
"negative","is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me ."
"negative","there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill ."
"negative","if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever ."
"negative","in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan ."
"negative","adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ?"
"negative","sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation ."
"negative","it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue ."
"negative","every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn ."
"negative","partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show ."
"negative","the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts ."
"negative","portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama ."
"negative","a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz ."
"negative","jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot ."
"negative","to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east ."
"negative","at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave ."
"negative","the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental ."
"negative","as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting ."
"negative","the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater ."
"negative","there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff ."
"negative","it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy ."
"negative","denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others ."

"negative","one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution ."
"negative","serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs ."
"negative","the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take ."
"negative","with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge ."
"negative","stale , futile scenario ."
"negative","deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness ."
"negative","a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment ."
"negative","like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste ."
"negative","it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt ."
"negative","the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life ."
"negative","another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues ."
"negative","shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere ."
"negative","i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it ."
"negative","complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort"
"negative","though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining ."
"negative","something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously ."
"negative","it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived ."
"negative","on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality ."
"negative","the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships ."
"negative","offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm ."
"negative","makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience ."
"negative","the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts ."
"negative","although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun ."
"negative","it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff ."
"negative","bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad ."
"negative","may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen ."
"negative","if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter ."
"negative","not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers ."
"negative","the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died ."
"negative","davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is ."
"negative","the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves ."
"negative","the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult ."
"negative","historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material ."
"negative","long time dead ? not nearly long enough ."
"negative","nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle ."
"negative","a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring ."
"negative","there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours ."
"negative","the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays ."
"negative","perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie ."
"negative","verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies ."
"negative","mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script ."
"negative","an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes ."
"negative","skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt ."
"negative","who needs love like this ?"
"negative","hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story ."
"negative","returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy ."
"negative","exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise ."
"negative","trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive ."
"negative","mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity ."
"negative","it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks ."
"negative","whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy ."
"negative","it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment ."
"negative","a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes ."
"negative","nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay ."
"negative","i'm just too bored to care ."
"negative","irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater ."
"negative","not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid ."
"negative","as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear ."
"negative","attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience ."
"negative","it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong ."
